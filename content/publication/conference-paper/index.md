abstract: In this work, we address the problem of control
synthesis for a homogeneous team of robots given a global
temporal logic specification and formal user preferences for
relaxation in case of infeasibility. The relaxation preferences
are represented as a Weighted Finite-state Edit System and are
used to compute a relaxed specification automaton that captures
all allowable relaxations of the mission specification and their
costs. For synthesis, we introduce a Mixed Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (MILP) formulation that combines the motion of the
team of robots with the relaxed specification automaton. Our
approach combines automata-based and MILP-based methods
and leverages the strengths of both approaches, while avoid-
ing their shortcomings. Specifically, the relaxed specification
automaton explicitly accounts for the progress towards satis-
faction, and the MILP-based optimization approach avoids the
state-space explosion associated with explicit product-automata
construction, thereby efficiently solving the problem. The case
studies highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach.
