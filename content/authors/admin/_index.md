Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Lehigh University under the guidance of Dr. Cristian-Ioan Vasile. My research vision is to create algorithmic frameworks for safe, perception-aware decision-making. My work focuses on developing robust methodologies for autonomous systems that can effectively perceive and interact with their environment while maintaining formal guarantees of safety and performance.
